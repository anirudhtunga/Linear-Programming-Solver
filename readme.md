# Linear Optimization Using Simplex and Interior Point Methods

## Simplex Method
- Matlab implementation of the two-phase simplex method with Bland's rule for finding the pivot. 

## Interior Point Method
- Matlab implementation of the INP mentod for linear optimization

## Usage
- Please refer to the `description.pdf` for code description, and examples using both the methods.
